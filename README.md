# Submission_3
This third assignment consists of creating our first animation with Unityâ€™s Mecanim animation system. In this animation my character, Amy, is preparing for a Hip Hop competition. Connecting the states to different keys, the character will go through different motions: warming up, performing simple dance moves, and finishing with a spectacular move.

In this upgrade, the scene is much more colorful since we added the materials and lights to our 3d objects!
